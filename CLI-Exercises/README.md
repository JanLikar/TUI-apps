# Linux CLI Text Processing Exercises

This is a **work-in-progress** TUI application to test your CLI text processing skills.

> **Note**  
> This application is intended for exercises based on Linux CLI tools. You might still be able to solve the exercises on other platforms, but I'm not sure if it works.

# Installation

You'll need to install `textual` first. See [Textual documentation](https://textual.textualize.io/getting_started/) for more details about installation. After that, you can clone this repository and run the `cli_exercises.py` script. Adjust terminal dimensions as needed. Example instructions shown below, adjust them based on your preferences and OS.

```bash
$ python3 -m venv textual_apps
$ cd textual_apps
$ source bin/activate
$ pip install textual==0.5.0

$ git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/learnbyexample/TUI-apps.git
$ cd TUI-apps/CLI-Exercises
$ python3 cli_exercises.py
```

After pressing **Ctrl+n** twice, you should get a screen similar to the one shown below:

# Guide

* Press **Ctrl+n** and **Ctrl+p** to navigate the questions list.
    * You can also click them using mouse from the footer.
* Type the command in the box below the question. Cursor focus is meant to be always within this box.
* Press **Enter** to execute the command.
    * `/bin/sh` is the shell used. So, features like `echo {1..3}` (brace expansion) won't work.
    * Output would be displayed below the command box.
    * If the output matches the expected results, the command box will turn *green* and a reference solution will also be shown.
    * Issues due to errors and timeout (about `2` seconds) will be displayed in *red*.
* Contents of the input file and expected output are shown at the bottom of the screen. You might have to scroll down to view longer files.
* Press **Ctrl+s** to show the reference solution if you are unable to solve an exercise.
* Press **Ctrl+t** to toggle between light and dark themes.
* Press **Ctrl+q** or **Ctrl+c** to quit the app.

> **Note**  
> Commands you have typed are automatically saved in `user_progress.json`. If you close the application and open it again, the first unsolved question will be displayed (i.e. already solved questions are skipped). If you use **Ctrl+s**, the solution *won't* be saved in `user_progress.json` â€” you'll have to navigate to another question and back (or close and open the app) to be considered for saving the changes. Once you have solved a question, only another correct solution can override the previously saved command.

> **Warning**  
> There is no safeguard against the command you are executing. They are treated as if you typed them from a shell session. For example, `ls` will list the contents of the current directory.
